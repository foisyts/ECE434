1. Where does Julia Cartwright work?
Julia Cartwright works at National Instruments.

2. What is PREEMPT_RT? Hint:Google it.
PREEMPT_RT is a real-time version of Linux that removes unbounded latencies; it can provide a  
smoother Linux experience by modifying the kernel.

3. What is mixed criticality? 
Mixed criticality is defined as the case when different tasks have different temporal 
sensitivities. Essentially, mixed criticality is when some tasks are time-critical at the 
same time that some are not. 

4. How can drivers misbehave? 
Drivers can misbehave when non-RT tasks are scheduled before RT tasks. This happens because
driver stacks are shared between tasks in PREEMPT_RT, which can lead to scheduling issues.

5. What is (delta) in Figure 1? 


6. What is Cylictest[2]?


7. What is plotted in Figure 2? 


8. What is dispatch latency? Scheduling latency?


9. What is mainline? 


10. What is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting?


11. Why can the External event in Figure 4 start sooner?
