## What's here? 
This repo contains the make folder, which has the makefile and 
all associated files, as well as info on the kernel update.

## Make
In make, there is a makefile that I wrote while following along with the 
exercise. Furthemore, the app.c file is there, as well as path.mak, which
both allow the makefile to execute. 

## Kernel 
Kernel could not be changed as it kept stalling during download - not sure
how to fix
