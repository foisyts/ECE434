1. What's the min and max voltage?
    The min was -55mV, while the max was 3.5V

2. What period and frequency is it?
    The period was 240.5ms and the frequency was 5.16Hz

3. How close is it to 100ms?
    Not very close -- it was off by 140.5ms

4. Why do they differ? 
    togglegpio does some setup and sleeping before execution, slowing down the period

5. Run htop and see how much processor you are using. 
    Currently, it is using 3.5% CPU

6. What's the shortest period you can get using sleep time? 
.1s/3.5%/0.2405
.05s/5.9%/0.144
.01s/12.8%/0.059
.001s/18.4%/0.048

7. How stable is the period?
    The period is progressively less stable as freq increaases

8. Try launching something like vi. How stable is the period?
    The period becomes more unstable using vi - it is very unstable

9. Try cleaning up togglegpio and removing unneeded lines. Does it impact the period?   
    Yes, the period becomes becomes shorter after removing unneeded lines.

10. togglegpio uses bash (first line in files). Try using sh. Is the period shorter? 
    The period becomes shorter using sh. 

11. What's the shortest period you can get? 
The shortest I saw was 14.9 ms
